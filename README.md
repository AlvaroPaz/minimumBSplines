MinimumBSplines is a Matlab toolbox related to the IEEE-ICRA-2019 paper.

The four examples demostrate the results according to:
- Example_01: RR planar robot.
- Example_02: Validation of analytical differentiation.
- Example_03: 5-link biped walker.
- Example_04: Biped walker for comparison purposes.

The folder "utils" contains basic functions.
